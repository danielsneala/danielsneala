- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Neal Daniels.
- I'm a hard-working individual seeking a data working position.  

- Recently completed a Post Graduate Program in Data Science & Business Analytics, using Python to analyze data. 

- I graduated Brigham Young University- Idaho with a degree in Applied Mathematics (July 2019), which included using R Programming to interpret data. 

- Experienced in learning and using different computer software to accomplish tasks.

- I did use some odd names in my college programming assignments in manipuating data but have since moved past that. It was just my way of showing some creativity. 

- I'm also learning SQL and other applications
